# This format is called YAML which stands for Yet Another Markup Language
# It's supposed to be machine readable, and human readable. It does a pretty
# good job of both of those goals, but there are some gotchas:
# it's structured as key: value pairs.
# You MUST have a space after that colon. key:value will break it.
# anything that starts with a #, like this line, is a comment. It's ignored by
# the computer.
# The tests check this file pretty carefully, so make sure it's properly filled in!
